// A generic MISO scheduler doesn't care about the label at all,
// it purely focus on scheduling packets from multiple inputs to a single output.
// However, since the type for packets we used here is interface{},
// the user is free to design its own struct for wrapping packets to make them tagged.
// For example, a packet of interface{} could be a MySimpleWrappedPacket{OriginPacket: xxx, Label: yyy}
// As for the type of input and ouput items of the channels, they are the same, i.e. the type of output items
// is exactly the same as the type of the input items.
